# npm resolution error report

While resolving: your-project-name@1.0.0
Found: @testing-library/dom@7.31.2
node_modules/@testing-library/dom
  @testing-library/dom@"^7.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @testing-library/dom@"^10.0.0" from @testing-library/react@16.0.0
node_modules/@testing-library/react
  dev @testing-library/react@"^16.0.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
