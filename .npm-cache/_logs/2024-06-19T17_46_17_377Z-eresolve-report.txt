# npm resolution error report

While resolving: your-project-name@1.0.0
Found: react@18.3.1
node_modules/react
  dev react@"^18.3.1" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"<18.0.0" from @testing-library/react@12.1.5
node_modules/@testing-library/react
  dev @testing-library/react@"^12.0.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
